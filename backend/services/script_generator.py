        3. **For EACH segment, generate AT LEAST THREE distinct visual suggestions.**
        4. **For EACH visual, you MUST ensure it is tightly aligned with the narration text at the visual's timestamp:**
           - If a segment has multiple visuals, break down the narration text so that each visual matches the exact part being spoken at its timestamp.
           - The visual's description MUST be contextually and temporally relevantâ€”do NOT use generic illustrations. The visual should clearly reflect what is being narrated at that moment.
           - Optionally, for each visual, include a `text_span` or short excerpt from the narration text that is being visualized at that timestamp.
        5. For each visual, also provide:
           - Timestamp: When the visual should appear within the segment (relative to the segment's start time, in seconds).
           - Duration: How long the visual should be displayed (in seconds).
           - Visual type (image, animation, diagram, or text)
           - Position (left, right, center, full)
           - Transition (fade, slide, zoom, none)
        6. VERY IMPORTANT: Provide at least 15 segments for each section
        
        Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
        {{
            "title": "Title of the video",
            "description": "Brief description of the video",
            "total_duration": total_duration_in_seconds,
            "sections": [
                {{
                    "title": "Section title",
                    "content": "Overview of the section",
                    "total_duration": section_duration_in_seconds,
                    "segments": [
                        {{
                            "narration_text": "Text to be narrated",
                            "start_time": start_time_in_seconds,
                            "duration": duration_in_seconds,
                            "visuals": [
                                {{
                                    "description": "Description for image generation, directly reflecting the narration text (MINIMALISTIC VISUAL).",
                                }}
                            ]
                        }}
                    ]
                }}
            ]
        }}
        
        **Important:** Make sure the script is engaging, educational, and appropriate for the target audience. Ensure the total duration is respected, segment timings are sequential, and visual timestamps/durations fit within their parent segment. The visual descriptions are critical â€“ make them specific and evocative. Generate AT LEAST TWO visuals per segment.
